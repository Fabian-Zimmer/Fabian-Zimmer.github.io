      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome, dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, thoughts are pretty messy, noisy, and transient. The proces of putting them in a coherent order and noting them down in an intelligable way is pretty hard. These posts are my attempts of this process, for topics that I deeply care about, are invested and interested in, and that I think wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to shape our thought processes a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are of a &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; nature, i.e. they are talked about more often in everyday life, whereas some less so. The ones that are less known are the ones that shaped my thinking and decision-making processes the most, and from which I have overall benefitted a lot in my life so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
