Therefore, whoever you are and however you found these writings, I hope that you can receive something from them, in whatever form that may be.\n","date":"June 18, 2025","hero":"/posts/welcome/hero.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/welcome/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome, dear reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, thoughts are pretty messy, noisy, and transient.
