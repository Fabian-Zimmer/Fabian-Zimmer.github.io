At first, we can think of certain criteria that any science needs to satisfy. These \u0026ldquo;demarcation criteria\u0026rdquo; have been heavily debated, especially over the last century, and have led to some important realisations in epistemology.\nTests and Puzzles Karl Popper, in his Science: Conjectures and Refutations (1963), proposed a simple one: falsifiability (or refutability, or testability). The more \u0026ldquo;risky\u0026rdquo; (as he called it) predictions a theory makes, the more falsifiable claims the theory has, and the better it is, according to Popper. For example, Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory of relativity had the \u0026ldquo;risky\u0026rdquo; prediction of the visibility of the bending of light during solar eclipses.1 Contrarily, a bad theory simply adds more devices to re-interpret its refutations, which then make the theory irrefutable. For example, when astrological predictions come out to be untrue, a new interpretation of the planets and stars leads to a corrected conclusion.\nMy attempt to summarize the view of Popper would be as follows. His falsifiability criterion characterises the progress of science as revolutionary and abrupt: if a grand prediction is falsified, the entire theory is rejected. The theories are then seen as preceding the problems they solve. Thomas Kuhn, in his Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research? (1970), argues against this by taking the inverse stance: hypotheses only arise after problems (he refers to them as \u0026ldquo;puzzles\u0026rdquo;) are posed by the current scientific corpus. Kuhn calls the incremental hypothesis testing of new ideas against current knowledge \u0026ldquo;normal science\u0026rdquo;, whereas the abrupt changes, i.e. the paradigm shifts, make up \u0026ldquo;extraordinary science\u0026rdquo;. It is easier to quote examples of extraordinary science, like the Wu experiments, which confirmed parity violation by the weak nuclear force. To fully understand normal science one would need to participate in, or regularly peek into universities and their everyday activities. Kuhn thinks that Popper has misunderstood what science for the majority does, and that one needs to look carefully at normal science to understand scientific evolution. Similar to watching the emergence of a butterfly from its cocoon: sure, the memorable moment was the hatching and the spreading of its beautiful wings, symbolising a new era, but the plethora of slow biological processes that were preceding the event, hidden inside the cocoon, are vital to understand how and why the butterfly emerged.\nThe importance of normal science and its puzzles is exemplified by astrology vs. astronomy. The failures of astrology were attributed to the complexity of all variables involved (the data of planets and the individual for whom the astrologer predicted something), and any failed prediction was useless and did not produce any problems that could further astrology. Astronomy\u0026rsquo;s failures, however, did indeed produce new puzzles whose solutions could rectify the methods used and allow the field to progress as a science. According to Kuhn, it is the emergence of a puzzle-solving tradition in a field that signifies abrupt changes, and this can happen even without well formulated and crucial tests and falsifications of older systems, which are simply left behind.\nProblems with Demarcation Criteria There is historical support for this, as theories like Ptolemaic astronomy were replaced before they had in fact been tested. In his Philosophical Papers Vol. 1, Imre Lakatos argues that, furthermore, only after a theory has been abandoned does one find mentions of so-called \u0026ldquo;crucial experiments\u0026rdquo; (which we will talk about more in part 3) and tests supposedly having been the cause of the abandonment. Lakatos sees scientific theories as research programmes: a core of principles and axioms (e.g. Newton’s 3 laws of mechanics and 1 law of gravitation), a protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses, and a problem-solving machinery. Any anomaly or seeming paradox is then attempted to be absorbed by the machinery and turned into positive evidence or corrected (or even new) hypotheses. Now the question becomes, how can these programs be identified as scientific and progressive, and differentiated from pseudo-scientific and degenerative?\nFor this, he appeals to novelty: unexpected and stunning predictions (e.g. the return of Halley\u0026rsquo;s comet in Newtonian theory or the visible offset of stars close to the Sun during eclipses in Einstein\u0026rsquo;s theory) that turn into facts are the hallmarks of progressive programs. Degenerative programs always lag behind facts and try to amend their theory to account for them. In this view, scientific revolutions are then associated with scientists gradually recognising, that a research program is becoming degenerative, while another is maturing and becoming progressive, leading to more and more practitioners switching to the new paradigm. Criticism should then account for this: a single criterion or failed test should not result in a complete refutation of a research program. Only due to the accumulation of them, together with the observation that the program cannot handle the onslaught of emerging tensions, can the program be deemed degenerative. Paul Thagard amends the research program view, in Why Astrology is a Pseudoscience (1978), by including social aspects of the practitioners.\nThe simple idea of demarcation criteria also fails in one of the most enlightening theories devised in human history: Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theory of evolution. There are no testable predictions of which species will evolve and adapt, but rather explanations of which did and why. Statements like those are effectively unfalsifiable. Nonetheless, Darwin\u0026rsquo;s theory gave rise to other theories that were testable (e.g. Mendelian genetics).\nLakatos makes another interesting point: technically, all theories (scientific and unscientific alike) are unprovable and unfalsifiable, in the sense that their generalising statements and laws are based on extrapolations made from limited evidence, and always will be. Take Newton\u0026rsquo;s inverse square law, that implies that all matter objects in the whole Universe attract each other. This was mainly based on measurements of objects in the Solar system alone — a limited set of evidence. Again technically, this tells us that Popper\u0026rsquo;s falsifiability criterion alone cannot be used to demarcate science from pseudoscience. Although this was indeed a powerful realisation, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be taken completely at face value however, as this argument rests on a specific take on Bayesian probabilities (which we will talk more about in Part 5).\n\u0026ldquo;Armchair Philosophy\u0026rdquo;? The relevancy of such philosophical discussions is perfectly exemplified by the Arkansas case in 1982, where it was to be determined whether creationism was a science or not, and if it was supposed to be taught in schools. The court decision, to declare creationism as non-scientific, was heavily influenced by the works and testimony of Michael Ruse in Creation-Science is not Science (1982). Although the decision was based on a list of criteria and conditions to be fulfilled by a genuine science, which was later criticised by Larry Laudan in Commentary: Science at the Bar — Causes for Concern, it was nevertheless the long debates in philosophical circles that had a causal connection with an impactful real-world decision.\nArguably, to this date, there is no consensus and the demarcation question remains unanswered. All the following parts in the anthology, that will be covered in the next posts, can be seen to provide more ideas, discussions, and advancements in the philosophy of science to contribute to the ongoing attempt to answer this defining question.\nSee this Nature article for a short overview of the experiment that confirmed Einstein\u0026rsquo;s prediction, and associated literature.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"June 19, 2025","hero":"/images/philosophy_of_science/part1.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/philosophy_of_science/part1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis posts is about part 1 of the anthology \u003ca href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/CURPOS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ePhilosophy of Science: Central Issues\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question addressed in this part seems simple: What counts as science, and what is mere pseudoscience, blind beliefs, and superstition?

Then, according to this notion, we can understand philosophy of science as the process of\nseeking to understand the scientific enterprise and its evolution, recognising the responsibilities that come with the advancements of science, and cultivating wisdom in both the philosopher and the scientific practices. The view we take on a certain topic shapes the questions we ask. And so, while the scientific practitioner may ask \u0026ldquo;how can I interpret my results?\u0026rdquo;, the philosopher of science could ask \u0026ldquo;why choose the specific methods that produced those results over any other?\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;are the methods scientific at all?\u0026rdquo; Engaging in such discussions, and attempting to answer these questions is vital to a degree that most modern people don\u0026rsquo;t realise. The commodities and services that we take for granted nowadays are based on a slow and challenging progress of our scientific understanding. Only by understanding which parts of our actions and experiments led to advances, i.e. by identifying which practices were scientific, has humanity bootstrapped itself from the stone age to the information age.\nPeriods in human history where the improvement of the \u0026ldquo;well-being\u0026rdquo; for people was slowed, halted, or even reversed, are often correlated with a the stagnation, repression, or lack of science. \u0026ldquo;Well-being\u0026rdquo; here is solely meant to represent the fact, that certain conditions or misfortunes do not condemn the individual to perish with high probability anymore. Examples that easily come to mind are health related (e.g. a broken hip, or a severe viral infection), or consequences of natural disasters (e.g. floods or poor harvest seasons). The arising life-threatening issues that come with said examples are more easily prevented and rectified with the help of current science (e.g. surgical treatments and global infrastructure for the two types of examples, respectively). These and similar chains of thought can serve as motivations, that contemplating the way in which we make progress, looking at the enterprise from a meta perspective in addition to an inside perspective, is important for understanding science as a whole.\nIn the series of posts in this Philosophy of Science category, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over the comprehensive anthology Philosophy of Science: Central Issues. The book is segmented into nine parts, and each post deals with one part. These parts are comprised of essays, articles, excerpts from books, and philosophy papers from various well-known intellectuals in this field, that share a common topic and address the issue of the chapter at hand. We will see that the topics are for more than just academic interest, and have real world impact by shaping the minds of individuals, future generations, and the course of society at large.\nIn my time at academia when doing my PhD, I regularly presented topics such as these in group meetings. For those I have made simple slides with drawings and texts by hand, which I attached below. They contain key take away messages from parts 1 – 3, which will be covered in the first three posts.\nPage: / Previous Next ","date":"June 18, 2025","hero":"/images/philosophy_of_science/intro.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/philosophy_of_science/intro/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe word Philosophy is composed of the Greek words for \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;lover\u0026rdquo;), and \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo;.
