# a summary about you
summary: |
  During my academic career path, culminating in a PhD in Physics at the University of Amsterdam, I learned about my aptitude for quickly absorbing, transforming, and disseminating knowledge. My passions include a few areas of science and philosophy. To ruminate and discuss the big question about reality and existence is also sought after daily.
  
  Currently, I endeavour to use my skills to help people/society/humanity in meaningful ways, and to contribute to our ever-growing understanding about who we are and want to be. My ongoing self-actualisation project can be portrayed with things I currently excel at, and things that I'm still actively improving, as listed on the right.

  About this website: It is the digital equivalent of my being. It serves as a documentation of my journey so far, as well as an archive for my personal thoughts and writings in the form of posts.
