        Title: Relic Neutrinos in Silico. </br>
        Summary: By developing a simulation code that simulates trajectory of cosmic background neutrinos, their history throughout the evolution of the Universe and their properties today were analysed. By looking at gravitational effects on various scales, the properties of relic neutrinos on Earth were predicted within the current cosmological model.

        Title: The Mysterious Gamma-Ray Excess of Andromeda — Comparing Millisecond Pulsars to Dark Matter. </br>
        Summary: A comprehensive study of data from the Fermi-LAT satellite, running statistical analyses to compare which physical model better fits the data: an astrophysical model with fast-spinning stellar remnants called neutron stars, or a dark matter annihilation model containing new physics.
