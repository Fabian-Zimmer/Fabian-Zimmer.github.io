The word Philosophy is composed of the Greek words for "friend" (or "lover"), and "wisdom". Combined, it symbolises the interplay of a kind and open attitude to knowledge and the responsibility that comes after attaining it. Then, according to this notion, we can understand philosophy of science as the process of 
- seeking to understand the scientific enterprise and its evolution, 
- recognising the responsibilities that come with the advancements of science, 
- and cultivating wisdom in both the philosopher and the scientific practices.

The view we take on a certain topic shapes the questions we ask. And so, while the scientific practitioner may ask "how can I interpret my results?", the philosopher of science could ask "why choose the specific methods that produced those results over any other?", or "are the methods scientific at all?" Engaging in such discussions, and attempting to answer these questions is vital to a degree that most modern people don't realise. The commodities and services that we take for granted nowadays are based on a slow and challenging progress of our scientific understanding. Only by understanding which parts of our actions and experiments led to advances, i.e. by identifying which practices were scientific, has humanity bootstrapped itself from the stone age to the information age.

Periods in human history where the improvement of the "well-being" for people was slowed, halted, or even reversed, are often correlated with a the stagnation, repression, or lack of science. "Well-being" here is solely meant to represent the fact, that certain conditions or misfortunes do not condemn the individual to perish with high probability anymore. Examples that easily come to mind are health related (e.g. a broken hip, or a severe viral infection), or consequences of natural disasters (e.g. floods or poor harvest seasons). The arising life-threatening issues that come with said examples are more easily prevented and rectified with the help of current science (e.g. surgical treatments and global infrastructure for the two types of examples, respectively). These and similar chains of thought can serve as motivations, that contemplating the way in which we make progress, looking at the enterprise from a meta perspective in addition to an inside perspective, is important for understanding science as a whole.

In the series of posts in this Philosophy of Science category, we'll go over the comprehensive anthology [Philosophy of Science: Central Issues](https://philpapers.org/rec/CURPOS). The book is segmented into nine parts, and each post deals with one part. These parts are comprised of essays, articles, excerpts from books, and philosophy papers from various well-known intellectuals in this field, that share a common topic and address the issue of the chapter at hand. We will see that the topics are for more than just academic interest, and have real world impact by shaping the minds of individuals, future generations, and the course of society at large.

In my time at academia when doing my PhD, I regularly presented topics such as these in group meetings. For those I have made simple slides with drawings and texts by hand, which I attached below. They contain key take away messages from parts 1 â€“ 3, which will be covered in the first three posts.
