This posts is about part 1 of the anthology [Philosophy of Science: Central Issues](https://philpapers.org/rec/CURPOS).

The question addressed in this part seems simple: What counts as science, and what is mere pseudoscience, blind beliefs, and superstition? At first, we can think of certain criteria that any science needs to satisfy. These "demarcation criteria" have been heavily debated, especially over the last century, and have led to some important realisations in epistemology. 

### Tests and Puzzles

Karl Popper, in his [Science: Conjectures and Refutations (1963)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61554.Conjectures_and_Refutations), proposed a simple one: falsifiability (or refutability, or testability). The more "risky" (as he called it) predictions a theory makes, the more falsifiable claims the theory has, and the better it is, according to Popper. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity had the "risky" prediction of the visibility of the bending of light during solar eclipses.[^1] Contrarily, a bad theory simply adds more devices to re-interpret its refutations, which then make the theory irrefutable. For example, when astrological predictions come out to be untrue, a new interpretation of the planets and stars leads to a corrected conclusion. 

My attempt to summarize the view of Popper would be as follows. His falsifiability criterion characterises the progress of science as revolutionary and abrupt: if a grand prediction is falsified, the entire theory is rejected. The theories are then seen as preceding the problems they solve. Thomas Kuhn, in his [Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research? (1970)](https://philpapers.org/rec/KUHLOO), argues against this by taking the inverse stance: hypotheses only arise after problems (he refers to them as "puzzles") are posed by the current scientific corpus. Kuhn calls the incremental hypothesis testing of new ideas against current knowledge "normal science", whereas the abrupt changes, i.e. the paradigm shifts, make up "extraordinary science". It is easier to quote examples of extraordinary science, like the [Wu experiments](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.105.1413), which confirmed parity violation by the weak nuclear force. To fully understand normal science one would need to participate in, or regularly peek into universities and their everyday activities. Kuhn thinks that Popper has misunderstood what science for the majority does, and that one needs to look carefully at normal science to understand scientific evolution. Similar to watching the emergence of a butterfly from its cocoon: sure, the memorable moment was the hatching and the spreading of its beautiful wings, symbolising a new era, but the plethora of slow biological processes that were preceding the event, hidden inside the cocoon, are vital to understand how and why the butterfly emerged.

The importance of normal science and its puzzles is exemplified by astrology vs. astronomy. The failures of astrology were attributed to the complexity of all variables involved (the data of planets and the individual for whom the astrologer predicted something), and any failed prediction was useless and did not produce any problems that could further astrology. Astronomy's failures, however, did indeed produce new puzzles whose solutions could rectify the methods used and allow the field to progress as a science. According to Kuhn, it is the emergence of a puzzle-solving tradition in a field that signifies abrupt changes, and this can happen even without well formulated and crucial tests and falsifications of older systems, which are simply left behind. 

### Problems with Demarcation Criteria

There is historical support for this, as theories like Ptolemaic astronomy were replaced before they had in fact been tested. In his [Philosophical Papers Vol. 1](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511621123), Imre Lakatos argues that, furthermore, only after a theory has been abandoned does one find mentions of so-called "crucial experiments" (which we will talk about more in part 3) and tests supposedly having been the cause of the abandonment. Lakatos sees scientific theories as research programmes: a core of principles and axioms (e.g. Newton’s 3 laws of mechanics and 1 law of gravitation), a protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses, and a problem-solving machinery. Any anomaly or seeming paradox is then attempted to be absorbed by the machinery and turned into positive evidence or corrected (or even new) hypotheses.
Now the question becomes, how can these programs be identified as scientific and progressive, and differentiated from pseudo-scientific and degenerative?

For this, he appeals to novelty: unexpected and stunning predictions (e.g. the return of Halley's comet in Newtonian theory or the visible offset of stars close to the Sun during eclipses in Einstein's theory) that turn into facts are the hallmarks of progressive programs. Degenerative programs always lag behind facts and try to amend their theory to account for them. In this view, scientific revolutions are then associated with scientists gradually recognising, that a research program is becoming degenerative, while another is maturing and becoming progressive, leading to more and more practitioners switching to the new paradigm. Criticism should then account for this: a single criterion or failed test should not result in a complete refutation of a research program. Only due to the accumulation of them, together with the observation that the program cannot handle the onslaught of emerging tensions, can the program be deemed degenerative. Paul Thagard amends the research program view, in [Why Astrology is a Pseudoscience (1978)](https://philpapers.org/rec/THAWAI), by including social aspects of the practitioners.

The simple idea of demarcation criteria also fails in one of the most enlightening theories devised in human history: Darwin's theory of evolution. There are no testable predictions of which species will evolve and adapt, but rather explanations of which did and why. Statements like those are effectively unfalsifiable. Nonetheless, Darwin's theory gave rise to other theories that were testable (e.g. Mendelian genetics).

Lakatos makes another interesting point: technically, all theories (scientific and unscientific alike) are unprovable and unfalsifiable, in the sense that their generalising statements and laws are based on extrapolations made from limited evidence, and always will be. Take Newton's inverse square law, that implies that all matter objects in the whole Universe attract each other. This was mainly based on measurements of objects in the Solar system alone — a limited set of evidence. Again technically, this tells us that Popper's falsifiability criterion alone cannot be used to demarcate science from pseudoscience. Although this was indeed a powerful realisation, it shouldn't be taken completely at face value however, as this argument rests on a specific take on Bayesian probabilities (which we will talk more about in Part 5).

### "Armchair Philosophy"?

The relevancy of such philosophical discussions is perfectly exemplified by the Arkansas case in 1982, where it was to be determined whether creationism was a science or not, and if it was supposed to be taught in schools. The court decision, to declare creationism as non-scientific, was heavily influenced by the works and testimony of Michael Ruse in [Creation-Science is not Science (1982)](https://philpapers.org/rec/RUSCSI-4). Although the decision was based on a list of criteria and conditions to be fulfilled by a genuine science, which was later criticised by Larry Laudan in [Commentary: Science at the Bar — Causes for Concern](https://philpapers.org/rec/LAUCSA-2), it was nevertheless the long debates in philosophical circles that had a causal connection with an impactful real-world decision. 

Arguably, to this date, there is no consensus and the demarcation question remains unanswered. All the following parts in the anthology, that will be covered in the next posts, can be seen to provide more ideas, discussions, and advancements in the philosophy of science to contribute to the ongoing attempt to answer this defining question.
