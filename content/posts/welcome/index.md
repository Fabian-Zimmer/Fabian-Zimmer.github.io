Welcome, dear reader.

Usually, thoughts are pretty messy, noisy, and transient. The process of putting them in a coherent order and noting them down in an intelligible way is pretty hard. These posts are my attempts of this process, for topics that I deeply care about, are invested and interested in, and that I think wouldn't hurt to shape our thought processes a little.

Some of them are of a "mainstream" nature, i.e. they are talked about more often in everyday life, whereas some less so. The ones that are less known are the ones that shaped my thinking and decision-making processes the most, and from which I have overall benefited a lot in my life so far.

There is also a "Book Notes" section, that contains writings about my favorite literature, in a mixed form of notes, comments, summaries, and personal thoughts while reading.

The main reason for writing these posts was two-fold: (i) to deepen my understanding of the information bundles I accumulate daily via (ii) explaining it to a member of the general audience. Therefore, whoever you are and however you found these writings, I hope that you can receive something from them, in whatever form that may be.
